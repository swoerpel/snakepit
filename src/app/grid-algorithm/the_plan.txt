image snake algorithm

1. load image
2. pixelize at desired cell size (gridify)
3. sort pixels by value (start with dark to light)
4. choose starting point for snake
5. let snake jump from high to low value cells
6. snake stops when trapped
7. goback to 4. repeat with new start point

8. repeate with multiple cell sizes and overlay images
